"""

A drop-in replacement for the `json` module. This is a take on implementing the json module from scratch.

The main goal is to be able to parse and serialize JSON data without using the `json` module and implementing the basic algorithms from scratch.

The main functions are `loads` and `dumps`.

def loads(json_str: str) -> dict
def dumps(data: dict) -> str
